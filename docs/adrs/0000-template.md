# ADR NNNN: Title in sentence case

**Status:** (Draft | Accepted | Deprecated)  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

What is the issue or driver we're addressing? Who is affected? What constraints (time, team, tech) matter?

## Decision

What we decided to do, in one or two short paragraphs. Be specific enough that a reader can tell whether a future change would contradict this ADR.

## Alternatives considered

- **Alternative A:** Brief description. Why we didn’t choose it (e.g. cost, complexity, risk).
- **Alternative B:** Same structure.
- *(Optional: “Do nothing” and why it was rejected.)*

## Consequences

- **Positive:** What we gain (e.g. explainability, speed, portability).
- **Negative / Tradeoffs:** What we give up or accept (e.g. less flexibility, ops burden).
- **Neutral:** Follow-on work or constraints (e.g. “we must document X”).

## How to revisit

Under what conditions should we reopen this decision? What would trigger an ADR update or a new ADR (e.g. “if we need to support real-time forecasts” or “if DuckDB becomes a bottleneck”)?
